A small and simple production rate calculator, made for my use in factory games such as Factorio, Satisfactory and others.
Based on the excellent [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui) crate. Very feature-light, not planning on expanding it.
Made as an exercise to better understand the calculations involved, and to practice/learn how to make a desktop application.
